            <h2>Life of fela</h2>
            <div id="tribute-info">
                <p>Fela was born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on 15 October 1938 in Abeokuta, the modern-day
                    capital of Ogun State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, then a city in the British Colony of
                    Nigeria, into an upper-middle-class family. His mother, Chief Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a feminist
                    activist in the anti-colonial movement; his father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, an
                    Anglican minister and school principal, was the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers.
                    His brothers Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors, were well known in
                    Nigeria. Fela is a first cousin to the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, the first
                    African to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p>

                <p>Fela attended Abeokuta Grammar School. Later he was sent to London in 1958 to study medicine, but
                    decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, the trumpet being his preferred
                    instrument. While there, he formed the band Koola Lobitos, playing a fusion of jazz and highlife. In
                    1960, Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have three children
                    (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Fela moved back to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria,
                    re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation.
                    He played for some time with Victor Olaiya and his All Stars.</p>

                <p>In 1967, Fela went to Ghana to think up a new musical direction. That was when Kuti first called his
                    music Afrobeat a combination of highlife, funk, jazz, salsa, calypso and traditional Nigerian Yoruba
                    music. In 1969, Fela took the band to the United States where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles.
                    While there, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Sandra Izsadore), a
                    partisan of the Black Panther Party. The experience would heavily influence his music and political
                    views. He renamed the band Nigeria '70. Soon afterwards, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
                    was tipped off by a promoter that Fela and his band were in the US without work permits. The band
                    performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as The '69 Los
                    Angeles Sessions.</p>

                <p>After Fela and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed the Afrika '70, as lyrical themes
                    changed from love to social issues. He formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio,
                    and a home for the many people connected to the band that he later declared independent from the
                    Nigerian state. According to Lindsay Barrett, the name "Kalakuta" derived from the infamous Black
                    Hole of Calcutta dungeon in India. Fela set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, first named the
                    Afro-Spot and later the Afrika Shrine, where he both performed regularly and officiated at
                    personalized Yoruba traditional ceremonies in honour of his nation's ancestral faith. He also
                    changed his name to Anikulapo (meaning "He who carries death in his pouch", with the interpretation:
                    "I will be the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time for death to take me"). He
                    stopped using the hyphenated surname "Ransome" because it was a slave name.</p>

                <p>Fela's music was popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general. In fact, he made the
                    decision to sing in Pidgin English so that his music could be enjoyed by individuals all over
                    Africa, where the local languages spoken are very diverse and numerous. As popular as Fela's music
                    had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was also very unpopular with the ruling government, and
                    raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. During 1972, Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious with
                    Fela appearing alongside Bobby Tench. Around this time, Kuti became even more involved in the Yoruba
                    religion.</p>

                <p>In 1977, Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers
                    using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash
                    hit and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic,
                    during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune. Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly
                    mother (whose house was located opposite the commune) was thrown from a window, causing fatal
                    injuries. The Kalakuta Republic was burned, and Fela's studio, instruments, and master tapes were
                    destroyed. Fela claimed that he would have been killed had it not been for the intervention of a
                    commanding officer as he was being beaten. Fela's response to the attack was to deliver his mother's
                    coffin to the Dodan Barracks in Lagos, General Olusegun Obasanjo's residence, and to write two
                    songs, "Coffin for Head of State" and "Unknown Soldier", referencing the official inquiry that
                    claimed the commune had been destroyed by an unknown soldier.</p>

                <p>In 1984, Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of
                    currency smuggling which Amnesty International and others denounced as politically motivated.
                    Amnesty designated him a prisoner of conscience, and his case was also taken up by other human
                    rights groups. After 20 months, he was released from prison by General Ibrahim Babangida. On his
                    release he divorced his 12 remaining wives, saying that "marriage brings jealousy and selfishness".
                </p>

                <p>Fela's album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether. In
                    1993, he and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle
                    against military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of Sani
                    Abacha. Rumours were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing
                    treatment.</p>

                <p>On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of
                    Health, announced his younger brother's death a day earlier from complications related to AIDS.
                    However, there has been no definitive proof that Kuti died from complications related to HIV/AIDS,
                    and much skepticism surrounds this alleged cause of death and the sources that have popularized this
                    claim. More than one million people attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound.
                    The New Afrika Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the
                    supervision of his son Femi.</p>
